As such, the program can be incorporated into a project archive.\r\n\r\n**mdtlc** was inspired by the **atlc** program which runs on a unix like platform. **atlc** can compute the transmission line characteristics for an arbitrary cross section as defined by a bitmap.  It provides the near ultimate flexibility for describing the transmission line cross section.  However, this format and flexibility increases the setup time needed to describe the physical characteristics of the transmission line.  \r\n\r\n**mdtlc** builds on the **atlc** base to provide a GUI based interface that allows a quick way to describe structures common in printed circuit board (PCB) design.  **mdtlc** takes the parameters used to describe the PCB structure, and generates the bitmap required for the **atlc** computation.  Once the computation is complete, the results are displayed in the GUI.\r\n\r\nMultiple dielectrics are supported in this approach to field solving.  As such, it is possible to observe the propagation delay differences between single-ended and differential signals caused by different dielectric constants of glass and resin.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, impedances can be checked for unusual cases such as when the differential pair is close to the edge of the board.\r\n\r\nThe github version of **mdtlc** is available to alow anyone to create or modify the source code.  The original project is hosted at http://mdtlc.sourceforge.net\r\n\r\nAdditional documentation, for the user and the developer, will be made available as it develops.\r\n",
